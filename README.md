# Genghis Competitive Bot System - Server
## A bot-battling game system for coders
Genghis is a framework that allows bots built by Computer Science 
students compete for resources, trade, and fight each other across 
multiple different battlegrounds. 
See the [Genghis Client](https://github.com/beyarkay/genghis_server) to get started.

## TODOs
### Important for getting people play-testing
1. Get some instructions for making a bot going
6. BACK-END: FIXED? Something's wrong with the attacking code. The graphs look like something is funky
7. BACK-END: actually go through the steps and try make a *good* bot


### Performance
* TODO instead of re-creating the svg files, just update them with new data

### Mobile

### UI/UX
* TODO Clicking on a plot brings it to the front
* TODO Give more RIGHT NOW information (who's move is it?, what tick is it?)
* TODO Add in hover info
* TODO Dark mode

### Nice to have
* TODO Allow NN training
* TODO Make a client version of the monitoring system
