# Genghis Competitive Bot System - Server
## A bot-battling game system for coders
Genghis is a framework that allows bots built by Computer Science 
students compete for resources, trade, and fight each other across 
multiple different battlegrounds. 
See the [Genghis Client](https://github.com/beyarkay/genghis_client) to get started.

## TODOs
### Important for getting people play-testing
1. Get some instructions for making a bot going
6. BACK-END: FIXED? Something's wrong with the attacking code. The graphs look like something is funky
7. BACK-END: actually go through the steps and try make a *good* bot

Users don't bother reading the full game timestamp. where possible, abbreviate it on the front end
Need to provide details about which bot is which, and how your bot is doing
Add in some error checking for step 5
Add in healing zones for bgs,  where bots can heal quickly
Add in health points for bots
maybe when a bot reaches 0hp it respawns with no coins? or maybe it just dies. Death is a good ultimatum, but fewer bots means fewer interactions
think about genghis server as a game engine that runs arbitrary games, and split the arbitrary game logic apart from the game engine logic
Games end either when there are not bots left or when the timer runs outm
Add in an explanation fro people who haven't setup nightmare before at all
Add in an explanation of what genghis is

### Performance
* TODO instead of re-creating the svg files, just update them with new data

### Mobile

### UI/UX
* TODO Clicking on a plot brings it to the front
* TODO Give more RIGHT NOW information (who's move is it?, what tick is it?)
* TODO Add in hover info
* TODO Dark mode

### Nice to have
* TODO Allow NN training
* TODO Make a client version of the monitoring system
