# Genghis Competitive Bot System - Server
## A bot-battling game system for coders
Genghis is a framework that allows bots built by Computer Science 
students compete for resources, trade, and fight each other across 
multiple different battlegrounds. 
See the [Genghis Client](https://github.com/beyarkay/genghis_server) to get started.

## TODOs
### Important for getting people play-testing
1. Get things synchronous properly
2. Update D3 plots, don't recreate D3 plots
3. Get a live badge working
4. Get a schedule of games going
6. Something's wrong with the attacking code. The graphs look like something is funky

### Performance
* TODO Get synchronous Server updates working, so you get 'push' notifications on the website client
* TODO instead of re-creating the svg files, just update them with new data

### Mobile
* TODO Doesn't work with the long game names
* TODO Battleground / graphs don't react properly to the thin format

### UI/UX
* TODO Give more RIGHT NOW information (who's move is it?, what tick is it?)
* TODO Add in all the hyperlinks to bots / battlegrounds
* TODO Add in hover info
* TODO Dark mode

### Features
* TODO able to follow either: battleground, bot, or whoever's turn it is at the moment
* TODO Enable the LIVE NOW dialogue to be accurate somehow
* TODO Get games going regularly with 

### Nice to have
* TODO Allow NN training
* TODO Make a client version of the monitoring system
